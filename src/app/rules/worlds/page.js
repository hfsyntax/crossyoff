      <Rule title="1. Qualifying/Matchmaking" />
      <RuleDescription>
      Players can qualify by having the first or second highest ELO/highscore (elo is the primary factor) for their country. Each player has 1 hour to get the highest score possible, best 2 of 3 games (number of forward hops). Players also have a maximum of 5 minutes to break between games. If a player exceeds the break time they will lose an attempt every 5 minutes exceeded. If both players in a round don't play, the player with the higher ELO/highscore advances.
      </RuleDescription>
      <Rule title="2. Moderation" />
      <RuleDescription>
      <b>A Referee is not required to be present for each match.</b> If a Referee is not present both players must save a downloadable copy of their stream as evidence of their runs. Referees decide whether a player wins, loses or is disqualified (if streams are reviewed). Players who are unsatisfied with the Referees decision must appeal to an Admin of the Discord Server. Admins have 24 hours to respond to the issue. If no response is given, the Referees decision is final.
      </RuleDescription>

      <Rule title="4. Withdrawl/Play Period" />
      <RuleDescription>
        Players have the ability to withdrawl themselves from the tournament whenever fit, however their funds contributed will be non-refundable and their ELO will still be affected.
      </RuleDescription>
      <Rule title="5. Ties" />
      <RuleDescription>
